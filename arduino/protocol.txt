This document describes the serial protocols that the robot uses to communicate, both over bluetooth and over the serial link from the arduino to the main board.
Ideally, most packets will be enterable by hand. At the very least, the shell
should be reachable with hand-typed packets.

Escape sequence: since packets are terminated by a specific character, should there be an escape sequence if we want to include that character in messages? We will need to escape it if shows up as the packet length (or maybe the packet type defines that?)

Acknowledgements? Serial links should be pretty reliable; do we really need acknoledgements?

General formats:
<ID> <\n>
<ID> <len> <data ... > <\n>

Message types:

Data from Robot:
Sonar data
GPS data (not sure if this is raw NMEA or parsed...)
Bump sensor data
Odometry count readings
Speed readings
Wheel slip notification?
Battery level readings
Reflex Settings
Hardware sleep/wake status

Data to Robot:
Motor Command
Steering Command
Reflex enable/disable/query
Power down (timed)
Hardware sleep/wake

Data through:
Laser Scanner data through.
Commands through
Direct shell access mode: bluetooth -> shell

Arduino shell mode; over bluetooth and serial.


A few thoughts on reflexes:
Reflexes are generally designed to save the robot from damage or prevent it
from damaging something else. They should be very simple, reactive
percept-to-action mappings that are implemented in firmware, quickly and
without processor intervention. Since sensors can fail, get stuck, or if the
robot is simply in a situation where it expects that reading, it should be
able to disable certain reflexes if necessary.
